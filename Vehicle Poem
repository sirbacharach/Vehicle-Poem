Vehicle Poem:

I like cars
I like motorcycles
I like busses
I like planes
I like spacecrafts
I like boats
I like ships
I like pedal bikes
I like hovercrafts
I like unicycles
I like helicopters
I like hot air balloons
I like zeplins
I like airships
I like parachutes
I like gyroplanes
I like jetskis
I like trucks

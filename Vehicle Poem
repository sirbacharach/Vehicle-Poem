Vehicle Poem:

I like cars with dogs onboard
I like motorcycles
I like busses with cats riding
I like planes
I like spacecrafts
I like boats
I like ships
I like bumpercars
I like pedal bikes
I like hovercrafts with dolphins alongside
I like unicycles
I like vans
I like helicopters
I like hot air balloons
I like zeplins
I like airships with birds flying by
I like parachutes
I like gyroplanes
I like jetskis
I like trucks
I like penny farthings
